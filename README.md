## Get Started

### Requirements

- **PHP 8.0+**
- **Laravel 8+**

### Installation

To install the package via composer, Run:

```bash
composer require opcodesio/log-viewer
```

After installing the package, publish the front-end assets by running:

```bash
php artisan log-viewer:publish
```

This command should also be appended to the list of post-update commands in your `composer.json`:

```bash
"post-update-cmd": [
    "Illuminate\\Foundation\\ComposerScripts::postUpdate",
    // ...
    "@php artisan log-viewer:publish"
],
```

### Usage

Once the installation is complete, you will be able to access **Log Viewer** directly in your browser.

By default, the application is available at: `{APP_URL}/log-viewer`.

(for example: `https://my-app.test/log-viewer`)

## Configuration

Please visit the **[Log Viewer Docs](https://log-viewer.opcodes.io/docs)** to learn about configuring Log Viewer to your needs.

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common problems and solutions.

### Problem: Logs not loading

At the moment, Log Viewer is only able to process [Laravel logs](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/logging) that look something like this:

```
[2022-08-25 11:16:17] local.DEBUG: Example log entry for the level debug {"one":1,"two":"two","three":[1,2,3]}
Multiple lines are allowed
and will be picked up as contents
of the same log entry.
```

If your logs are structured differently, then you'll have to wait until we ship support for custom log formats. Otherwise, please adjust your log format to Laravel's default.
